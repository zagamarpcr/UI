Inside the settings menu the only setting is light/dark mode, in the notifications there is only a example notification, when hoveered will display a tiny bar on the bottom with the trashcan icon, it dosent do anything for now, also added a people, and Games tab, it took a while to fix the animations becouse they were so broken :( they dont do anything yet, BUT as soon as i figure out how to save peoples login info on database, then i can implement chat system.
